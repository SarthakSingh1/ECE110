; Purpose: The purpose of this program is to add all the positive values
; in a set of 10 numbers and store them in a register

; Registers and Use
; R3 is what stored the address of the 10 numbers
; R5 is what the sums were added to to get the final sum
; R4 was the counter to make sure the  program  ran for all 10 numbers
; R6 is what stores the memory off the adress of R3

;Code starts here
 
0011 0001 0000 0000     ; Initialize at x3100
1110 011 000110001	; R3 <- PC+3	         	 Makes R3 equal to the first number(x3132)
0101 101 101 1 00000	; R5 <- R5 AND 0 	         "AND" R5 with 0 to initialize it to 0
0101 100 100 1 00000	; R4 <- R4 AND 0                 "AND" R4 with 0 to initialize it to 0
0001 100 100 1 01010	; R4 <- R4 + 10		         Adding R4 to 10 to set it equal to 10
0110 110 011 000000     ; R6 <- M[R3+0]		         Get the value at R3 and store it in R6
0000 100 000000001      ; if n, PC <- PC+1               Check if R is negative if it is go to the line 9
0001 101 110 0 00 101	; R5 <- R5+R6		         R5 = R5+R6
0001 011 011 1 00001	; R3 <- R3+1		         Increase R3 by 1
0001 100 100 1 11111	; R4 <- R4+(-1)		         Decrease Ri4 by 1
0000 101  111111010     ; if np, PC <- PC+(-6)	         If R4 is NOT 0 go up to line 6
1111 0000 0010 0101	; PC <- M[ZEXT(x25)		 Halt code
